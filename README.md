# bayesian_stats
This comes from the workshop I attended in 2023 "Computational Summer school Modeling social and collective behaviour" (https://cosmos-konstanz.github.io/). I learned about reinforcement learning, social and asocial information, and the power of Bayesian data analysis to fit complex models to data. To better learn the topics, I tried to apply some of what we learned on my own. Hence, the attached code is mine (with all its problems).
