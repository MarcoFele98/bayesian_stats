# bayesian_stats
This comes from the workshop I attended in 2023 "Computational Summer school Modeling social and collective behaviour" (2023, https://cosmos-konstanz.github.io/). I learned about reinforcement learning, social and asocial learning, and the power of Bayesian data analysis to fit complex models to data. The attached code is mine (with all its bugs).
